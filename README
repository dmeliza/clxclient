This repository is a copy of the latest source for clxclient, a lightweight C++
X11 toolkit by Fons Adriaensen <fons@kokkinizita.net>. It's hosted here because
the source was getting difficult to find elsewhere, and the library is needed
for some really nice audio software. Requires clthreads
(https://codeberg.com/dmeliza/clthreads).
